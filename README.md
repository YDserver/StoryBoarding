# StoryBoarding React App

This app lets you build a multi-scene storyboard for 3D animation SOPs. Each scene includes a title, description, dialogue and an image that can be uploaded or generated using a mock AI image function. You can preview scenes live and export the storyboard as a multi-page PDF.

## Features

- Add, edit and delete scenes
- Optional AI image generation via a mocked `generateImage` function
- Live scene preview
- Export all scenes as a single PDF
- Tailwind CSS styling
